## We organized and invited Cosmos Hub Manager to the Interchain Summit 2025 in Berlin
<img width="2500" height="1419" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6acbc71-51bd-4ea3-8112-cd4f5a966996" />


## We launched quest and task campaign about [Cosmos on Centrifuge Platform](https://centrifuge.digital/cosmos)

<img width="2861" height="813" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee8a165a-3d36-4721-97c9-42fd9cff6af1" />

## We spread the information about Cosmos Hub among russian-speaking community of Cosmos Ecosystem:
### YouTube
This is our big part of humanitarian side of our contibutions for Cosmos Hub:
We have several YouTube channels: 
1. [CryptoBase](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT8g3Ki-EO0UHhP2DFPXi2A)
2. [PostHuman](https://www.youtube.com/c/POSTHUMAN)
3. [CryptoSlovo](https://www.youtube.com/c/CryptoSlovo/videos) 

## Videos 
<img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/0i9YSN22TzE/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" />

Content creation is what we are truly passionate about, as well as validation. Our goal is to provide informational and educational support not only via text but also through videos! Here are a couple of examples of what we do: we have two YouTube channels. 

> One is Russian-speaking - [CRYPTOBASE](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT8g3Ki-EO0UHhP2DFPXi2A) with approximately 10k subscribers. Our videos are educational and informational, featuring guests who are founders, creators, developers, and enthusiasts. We cater not only to Russian speakers but also to English speakers, always providing timely translations for them. We've hosted guests such as Omniflix, Persistence, Archway, Asset Mantle, Injective, Warden Protocol, Massa, Sei, CryptoDungeons, Odin, Quasar, and many more founders and community developers of Cosmos Ecosystem projects on our special, Cosmos Ecosystem dedicated community calls. We have been doing this weekly for over 200 weeks in a row!

> Second one is [POSTHUMAN YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT8g3Ki-EO0UHhP2DFPXi2A). It's still is under development and doesn't have any specific structure for now and from the first look, might appear as chaotic and random, but there are collection of videos from conferences, interviews with projects and founders, tutorials and recordings (take it as the video version of portfolio/github) of our POSTHUMAN community calls.

## Validator School
Posthuman and Sputnik Foundation launch a Validator School, which will help you acquire the necessary knowledge to validate blockchains, and will provide full online support from the beginning to the launch of the validator.
The most capable students will be able to synchronize with the Distributed Validators Synctems.
