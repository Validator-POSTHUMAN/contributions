## Infrastructure

```

**Have you been slashed or jailed in the last 6 months on Namada or other chains you validated on? If so, which chains have you been slashed or jailed on?**  
```
In the past six months, we experienced slashing on both Cosmos Hub and Injective. We conducted internal post-mortems, identified and resolved all issues. Taking full responsibility for our mistakes, and in the interest of maintaining our reputation, we fully compensated all slashed assets—adding a 25% premium to ensure fairness.
